# Asus Rog Ally Ultimate Resolutions

## Introduction

Welcome to Rog Ally Ultimate Resolutions, a package of `12` additional resolutions for your Asus Rog Ally, along with the 3 standard resolutions for a total of `15` Resolutions. These registry keys were created to address the need for more resolution options, particularly for retro gaming. They resolve issues with games that may not adapt well to the Rog Ally's 3 standard resolutions `(1920x1080, 1600x900, 1280x720)`.

In total, you now have the option to choose from 30 settings, including `120Hz` and `60Hz`. The resolutions include:

- 1920x1080
- 1760x990
- 1680x1050
- 1600x900
- 1366x768
- 1280x1024
- 1280x720
- 1128x634
- 1024x768
- 1024x576
- 960x540
- 854x480
- 800x600
- 640x480
- 320x240 `(Note: This resolution is included but currently cannot be selected; it may not appear as an option in games for now.)`

As these are custom resolutions, Windows will display only `10` of them in `Settings --> System --> Display --> Display resolution`.

If you need access to the missing resolutions, navigate to `Settings --> System --> Display --> Advanced display`, click on `Display adapter properties for Display 1` and press the `List All Modes` button.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Installing Rog Ally Ultimate Resolutions
To install the 15 resolutions, download the system registry key from the "Releases" section.

[![Download Rog Ally Ultimate Resolutions](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Special-Niewbie/Asus-Rog-Ally-Ultimate-Resolutions/total.svg)](https://github.com/Special-Niewbie/Asus-Rog-Ally-Ultimate-Resolutions/releases/latest)

Unzip the downloaded file, run `Rog_Ally_Ultimate_Resolutions_v1.0.reg`, and confirm the installation to activate the resolutions. After installation, restart your system.

### 2. Reverting to Standard Resolutions

If you wish to return to the 3 standard resolutions (1920x1080, 1600x900, 1280x720) without the option to choose others, install the registry key named `Rog_Ally_3_Standard_Resolutions.reg` and restart your system. Your Rog Ally will revert to its native 3 resolutions.

## Additional Information

For users who want to customize the display scaling for 4:3 resolutions, access the AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition control panel. Navigate to `Gaming --> Display` and set the `Scaling Mode` to `Full panel`. This will stretch `4:3` resolutions to fit the `16:9` panel.
